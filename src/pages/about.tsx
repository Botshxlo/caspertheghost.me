          Hello, I am Casper! {"I'm"} a {age} year old programmer and student based in Belgium. I
          adore building accessible and fast code. {"I'm"} also a big fan of open-source, I
          contribute to open-source as much as I can, I also have{" "}
          <a

          >
            many open-source projects
          </a>{" "}
          of my own.
        </p>

        <p style={{ marginTop: "0.5rem" }}>
          I have been developing web applications, Discord bots and npm packages for about 2 years
          and love it! {"I'm"} learning something new almost every day! I am currently focusing on
          frontend web development. Specifically working with React.js, TypeScript, CSS, HTML and
          much more!
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          I also like interacting with GitHub repositories to expand my knowledge about technologies
          and web development in general.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          When {"I'm"} not programming or in school, I enjoy to go mountain biking in my local town.
          I also love skiing!
        </p>

        <br />
