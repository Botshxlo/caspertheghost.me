## Requirements

There are a few things you must have.

- A Next.js project
- <abbr title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</abbr> with Ubuntu 20.04
- Minimal experience in the terminal
- A domain (only required for NGINX proxy)

## Prepare VPS for deployment

There are a extra steps that we must perform so we can properly deploy our Next.js project to our domain.
This includes installing Node.js, installing NGINX and setting up the firewall.

### Installing required packages

#### Node.js

To install Node.js there are few simple steps required.
Get the Node.js install via [Nodesource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#readme).

```bash --command=true
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
```

Run the Nodesource setup file to prepare the correct version of Node.js

```bash --command=true
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
```

Install Node.js from the installed Nodesource

```bash --command=true
sudo apt install nodejs -y
```

Verify installation:

```bash --command=true
node -v # 18.x.x
```

#### NGINX

NGINX will be used as a proxy to serve our Next.js project.

```bash --command=true
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

### Firewall

We must set up a firewall to only allow certain ports on our VPS. We will only allow `22` for SSH, `80` for HTTP and `443` for HTTPS

```bash
sudo ufw allow ssh # 22
sudo ufw allow "Nignx Full" # 80 and 443
```

To verify this worked, you can run the following command

```bash --command=true
sudo ufw status
```

<Info title="Firewall disabled?">

    <summary>If your firewall is disabled, you can run this simple command to enable it ðŸ‘‰</summary>

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

  </details>

</Info>

## Next.js project setup on a VPS

First, we must be logged into our VPS. We will clone the Next.js project from GitHub onto our VPS.

```bash
# replace this URL with your repo
git clone https://github.com/Dev-CasperTheGhost/nextjs-ts-eslint-template.git
```

Now we must install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
# OR
yarn
```

Once all the dependencies are installed, we can build the client so it is ready to be deployed.

```bash
npm run build
# OR
yarn build
```

Now we can start the project in the background using `pm2`.

<Info >
  <details  style={{marginTop: 10}}>
    <summary>If you don't have `pm2` installed yet, see the following command ðŸ‘‰</summary>

```sh
sudo npm install --global pm2
```

  </details>
</Info>

```bash
# `run start` is the command that will be executed.
pm2 start npm --name my-project -- run start
```

This will have successfully started the project.
You can verify this with `pm2 logs` or open the IP with the port in your browser.

### NGINX configuration

Once we've installed all the required packages, we can configure NGINX to serve our Next.js project.

#### NGINX proxy setup

Start by opening the following file with a text-editor: `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`. I will use nano for this.

```bash --command=true
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

_You might already see some configurations, you can safely remove this._

We can now start editing this file and add our own `server` block.

```bash
server {
  # the name of your domain, www is optional.
  server_name my-domain.com www.my-domain.com;

  location / {
    # this must stay localhost. The port must be the same as your Next.js project
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }

  # simple headers
  add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
  add_header X-XSS-Protection          "1; mode=block" always;
  add_header X-Frame-Options DENY always;

  # this will serve the project on port 80
  listen 80;
}
```

Once done editing, save and exit the editor and verify the config file with the following command:

```bash --command=true
nginx -t
```

You may have noticed that we are serving the project on port 80. This is fine for now, since we haven't installed our certificates yet.
If you **do not** need a secure site, you can skip to [#final-deployment-steps](#final-deployment-steps)! Continue reading on how to install certificates with [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).

### Installing certificates with Cerbot

Cerbot can be installed in many ways and on many machines with different configurations, therefore please follow [Cerbot's installation guide](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions).

After following Cerbot's instructions, you should verify if it changed the NGINX config, open the config file and see changes made.

```bash --command=true
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

Now you should see that the `server` block will serve the project on port 443 (HTTPS)!

## Final Deployment steps

As our last step, we must restart NGINX with this simple command:

```bash --command=true
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Now verify that all is running, head over to your domain and see the project in action ðŸŽ‰!

## The end

That's it! You've successfully set up NGINX on Ubuntu and deployed a Next.js project to it
