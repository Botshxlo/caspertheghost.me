## Getting Started

This blog post will explain how you can easily add [Preact] to your Next.js application to reduce Next.js' bundle size.

<Info style={{ margin: "1rem 0" }}>
  **Note:** Some features in React.js that are not yet supported in Preact, [may break some parts in
  your Next.js application](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/issues/863).
</Info>

### Preact installation

Preact can be easily installed with the following command

```bash
npm install preact
# or
yarn add preact
# or
pnpm add preact
```

### Next.js configuration

To enable Preact, we must edit our [Next config](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/introduction).

```js:next.config.js
module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, { dev, isServer }) => {


    // Note, preact is only enabled for production builds (`next build`)
    if (!dev && !isServer) {
      config.resolve.alias = {
        ...config.resolve.alias,
        "react/jsx-runtime.js": "preact/compat/jsx-runtime",
        react: "preact/compat",
        "react-dom/test-utils": "preact/test-utils",
        "react-dom": "preact/compat",
      };
    }

    return config;
  },
}
```

### Usage

Once you build your Next.js application, you should see a decrease in bundle size.
Below you can see the results on my site.
