## Introduction

home-inventory is a web application to keep track of items in your house such as food items, medical supplies, tech, etc.

<div className="flex items-center gap-2">

    className="h-9 flex w-fit items-center gap-2 rounded-md transition-colors py-2 px-3 bg-gray-300 dark:bg-blue-3 focus:bg-gray-400/80 hover:bg-gray-400/80 hover:dark:bg-blue-4 font-normal no-underline group"

## Idea

I wanted to know what kinds of tech, foods, and miscellaneous items I have in my house so I could know when I should buy new ones or know when they almost expire.
But that wasn't all, I wanted: a modern and good looking UI, a "quick-view dashboard" to see what is low on quantity or is almost expired.

Sorting, filtering and categorization was also a must. Filtering and sorting was done with `@tanstack/react-table`. Administrators could manage the categories that could be given to a item.
Another cool feature was to authenticate with an OAuth provider, I chose Google Oauth because it is the most popular. Administrators can also add or remove users from their houses.

## Future ideas

A way to import or export items will definitely be needed for faster and easier management.

## Technologies

home-inventory is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [React.js](https://reactjs.org) with a [tRPC](https://trpc.io) API. I chose this tech to learn about tRPC and see what I could build with it.
At the same time, I also learned how to use `react-query`.

I will most likely use tRPC again in future projects because it's so fast to setup and easy to use.

I'm using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) to style the UI. Using tRPC with react-query to manage server-state, client-state uses `React.useState` for local state.
Using `react-hook-form` for building forms, validating them with `zod` schemas. The API uses the same schema as the frontend for body validation.

home-inventory's data is saved in a MongoDB database, I found it the easiest way to store the data in the cloud.
Personally, I think [Prisma](https://prisma.io) is the best decision as database ORM.
