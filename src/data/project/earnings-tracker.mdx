## Introduction

Earnings tracker is an web application built primairly to track my income and expenses. I'm a student and can only work certian amout of hours per week and earn X amount per year legally in Belgium.
Therefore it was important for me to track my income to make sure I wasn't going over the limits. I also wanted to track my expenses to make sure I wasn't spending too much money.

## Technologies

Earnings Tracker is built using Next.js and tRPC. I've never used tRPC before but I've heard a lot of good things about it. tRPC is very easy to use and it's very fast.
I've also used TypeScript before and It's a great language for building frontend web apps.

- Next.js
- tRPC
- ESLint & Prettier
